## About Product Design

To my understanding, product design describes the incorporation of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to generate a product for users. Therefore, a product 
designer is a "full stack designer" because he or she is a UI (frontend) designer and a UX (backend) designer.

## Difference between UI design and UX design

UI design is the design that focuses on the aesthetics and feel of how a final product will be, while UX design aims to make every products and services 
user-friendly and accessible as possible. Some of the tools that can be used for a product design are;

     * Figma 
     * Adobe XD
     * Whimsical
     * Photoshop
